# B9-PWings-Fork
Fork of Bac9's Procedural Wings mod for KSP: reworking for better experiences

Pre-modified by Crzyrndm.

This is a modified version made by Lithane, or 01010101lzy.

*THIS IS AN ALPHA VERSION OF THE MOD, SO EXPECT WIERD ISSUES*

Modification includes:

* Expanding wing properties range;
   
* Adding a new, sweptback-angle-based wing definition system (unfinished);
   
*  Scale edges with thickness (not started);
   
* Include or exclude edges in calculations (not started).
   
Licenced under MIT, the same as Bac9's one.

Feel free to fork.
